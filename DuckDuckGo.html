                    <li>How does DuckDuckGo make money?</li>
                    <p>We make our money from private ads on our search engine. 
                        On other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled about you using your personal information like search, browsing, and purchase history. 
                        Since we don’t collect that information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you are viewing, not on you as a person. 
                        For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. Learn more </p>
